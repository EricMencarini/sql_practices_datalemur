## üöÄ Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to study SQL with a focus on data engineering. By exploring a variety of problems and their solutions, you can:

- Understand different approaches to solving the same SQL problem.
- Learn best practices for writing clean, efficient, and scalable SQL queries.
- Prepare for technical interviews and real-world data engineering tasks.
- Studie for different approaches for each problem

## Topics Covered

- Aggregations and grouping
- Window functions
- Joins and subqueries
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Analytical and reporting queries

## Credits

Many of the problems are inspired by or sourced from [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/), a platform for practicing SQL and data science interview questions.

**Note:** This repository contains only the free questions from Datalemur and is intended for personal study and practice, especially for those interested in data engineering with Sql.
