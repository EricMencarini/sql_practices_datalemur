/*
A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is defined as a customer who has purchased at least one product from every product category 
listed in the products table.

Write a query that identifies the customer IDs of these Supercloud customers.

Example Output:
customer_id
1
Explanation:
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
