/*

This is the same question as problem #11 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. 
Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user. Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

Example Output:
user_id	spend	transaction_date
111	89.60	02/05/2022 12:00:00
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

       ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date ASC) as Rank
FROM transactions
)

SELECT user_id,
       transaction_date,
       spend
FROM Rank_Transactions
