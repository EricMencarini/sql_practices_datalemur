/*
A phone call is considered an international call when the person calling is in a different country than the person receiving the call.

What percentage of phone calls are international? Round the result to 1 decimal.

Assumption:

The caller_id in phone_info table refers to both the caller and receiver.

Explanation
There is a total of 4 calls with 2 of them being international calls (from caller_id 1 => receiver_id 5, and caller_id 5 => receiver_id 1). 
Thus, 2/4 = 50.0%
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
