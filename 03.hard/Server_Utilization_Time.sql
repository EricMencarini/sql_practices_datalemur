/*
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.

Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.

Assumptions:

Each server might start and stop several times.
The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each server's uptime.

Example Output:
total_uptime_days
21
Explanation
In the example output, the combined uptime of all the servers (from each start time to stop time) totals 21 full days.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
